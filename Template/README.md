You are controlling a "worm", you have to reach the green rectangle to win the game.
Avoid the red obstacles as if you touch them you lost the game!

You can grow your worm by pressing two neighbouring keys, the worm will grom in the direction of the second yes you press down.

To move forward, let go of the first key you pressed after the worm started growing, while keeping the second key pressed down.

Good luck!
